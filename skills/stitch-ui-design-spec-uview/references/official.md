## Usage Principles in this Skill

1. This skill does **NOT** output runnable uView code. It outputs consistency constraints (tokens / component contracts / states / layout invariants) for Stitch generation.
2. When the user provides `stitch-skills/docs/*.md` (e.g., PRD), prioritize the structure and edge cases in the document, and selectively inject component contracts and state snippets (do not inject everything).
