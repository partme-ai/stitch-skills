# Stitch Skill Creator

This skill guides the creation of new **Stitch Scenario Skills**. A Scenario Skill is a specialized "Prompt Architect" for a specific domain (e.g., `stitch-ui-music-designer`, `stitch-ui-blog-designer`).

## Core Philosophy

All Stitch Skills created by this creator **MUST** adhere to the **Stitch Design SOP**:

1.  **Trigger Safety**: The skill must ONLY trigger when the user explicitly mentions "Stitch".
2.  **Design First**: Never call `stitch-mcp-screen-generate` immediately. First, construct a high-quality prompt.
3.  **Self-Contained**: The skill should act as a specialized "Prompt Template" that encapsulates domain knowledge (e.g., a Music App needs a "Play Button", "Cover Art").

## Skill Creation Workflow

### Option A: Automated Creation (Recommended)

Use the bundled script to automatically generate the skill structure, `SKILL.md` (with Golden Template), and `examples/usage.md`.

```bash
# Usage: ./scripts/init_stitch_skill.py <scenario-name> --path <skills-directory>
./scripts/init_stitch_skill.py music-designer --path skills/
```

This will automatically:
1.  Create `skills/stitch-ui-music-designer`.
2.  Populate `SKILL.md` with the required SOP and Templates.
3.  Create `examples/usage.md`.

### Option B: Manual Creation

### Step 1: Define the Scenario
Identify the domain and name the skill following the strict naming convention: `stitch-ui-<scenario>-designer`.
*   *Example Scenario*: "Music Apps"
*   *Skill Name*: `stitch-ui-music-designer` (MUST start with `stitch-ui-`)
*   *Example Scenario*: "Login Pages"
*   *Skill Name*: `stitch-ui-login-designer`

### Step 2: Create Directory Structure
```bash
mkdir -p skills/stitch-ui-<scenario>-designer/examples
```

### Step 3: Write `SKILL.md` (The Golden Template)
You **MUST** use the following template for the new skill. It enforces the required SOP.

# <Scenario> Screen Designer

**Constraint**: Only use this skill when the user explicitly mentions "Stitch" or when orchestrating a Stitch design task.

This skill helps you construct high-quality prompts for <Scenario> flows to be used with `stitch-mcp-screen-generate`.

## Functionality
It encapsulates best practices for <Scenario> UI design and translates user intent into a structured Stitch prompt.

## Integration with Stitch Designer SOP
This skill is part of the **Stitch UI Orchestration** flow.
1.  **Orchestrator**: `stitch-ui-designer` calls this skill in Step 3.
2.  **Guidelines**: You MUST apply principles from `stitch-ued-guide` (e.g., visual vocabulary, device constraints).
3.  **Output**: You do NOT execute the generation. You return a **Prompt String**.

## Prompt Template

When the user asks for a <Scenario> screen, use this template to construct the `prompt` argument for `stitch-mcp-screen-generate`:

```text
[Device] <Scenario> screen for [App Name]. [Style] aesthetic.
Layout: [Specific Layout for Scenario].
Header: [Scenario Header Components].
Main Content:
- [Component 1]
- [Component 2]
Footer: [Scenario Footer Components].
```

## Usage in Orchestrator
This skill is designed to be called by `stitch-ui-designer` (Step 3). It does NOT execute the generation itself; it returns the **Prompt String** to the Orchestrator or User.
````

### Step 4: Write `examples/usage.md`
Provide at least 2 distinct examples of how this skill transforms a vague request into a detailed prompt.

## Best Practices for New Skills

1.  **Domain Specificity**: The value of a Scenario Skill is in its *specific knowledge*.
    *   *Bad*: "A page with text."
    *   *Good (Music)*: "A player view with a scrubbing bar, album art, and waveform visualization."
2.  **Device Awareness**: Ensure the template supports Mobile (default) and Desktop.
3.  **No Direct Execution**: The Scenario Skill should **NOT** call `stitch-mcp-screen-generate` directly. It produces the *prompt* that `stitch-ui-designer` uses. This ensures the "Design First" separation of concerns.
